## 1.Goal

To provide

- Data-driven actionable plan to help business owners improve their ratings on Yelp. 

- Key useful, analytical insights from the data (e.g. plots, tables, models, inferential methods, etc.) .
- A demonstration of your Shiny application.

## 2.Data Cleaning

Limited by the computing power, we chose to focus on restaurants whose category contained the word "steak".

The `yelp.ipynb` in `code` folder is used to clean the data and create the word frequency table and the large word embedding table with original views.

After filtering and combination, the `steak_cleaned.csv` has 33629 rows Ã— 6085 columns.

## 3.Insights about Steak Restaurants

### 3.1 Different Types of Steak

Firstly, let's check the common types of steaks and how their ratings distribute. These steaks are also the ones that appear many times in the comments.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../image/steak_type.jpg")
```


We found that tomahawk, skirt, hanger and flank steaks tends to obtain 5-star comments more easily. The portion of their 5-star comments is significantly over 45%.

However, customers seem to be more picky on sirloin, round and cube steak according to the data. The portion of their 5-star comments is roughly less than 30%.

### 4.2 Advice on improving an existed steak restaurant

In the aspect of steaks:

- Try to improve tomahawk, skirt, hanger and flank steaks if one of them has brought your restaurant many low-star comments since the customers are not so picky about them.

- Advertise your sirloin, round and cube steaks if one of them has brought your restaurant high-star comments. It is very praiseworthy to have highly rated sirloin, round and cube steaks.
